# 1768. Maximal K-clique

## Description

Given a simple undirected graph, please find all the **maximal k-clique subgraphs**.

A **k-clique** is a subset of `k` nodes such that every pair of nodes is connected by an edge.  
A **maximal k-clique** means it is not contained in any larger k-clique (i.e., it cannot be extended by including any adjacent vertex).

---

## Input Format

Each line contains an edge represented by a pair of node numbers `(u, v)` separated by a space:


- Nodes are labeled from `0` to `n`, where `n < 100`
- The graph is undirected and simple (no duplicate edges, no self-loops)

## Output Format

The output format is specified in the course document `hw3.pdf`.  
Please follow the instruction provided in the course material for expected output structure.
