# Chromatic Number of a Graph

## Description

Given a simple undirected graph, please find the **chromatic number** of the graph.

The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Input Format

Each line contains an edge, represented by a pair of node numbers separated by a space:

u v  

- Nodes are labeled from `0` to `n`, where `n < 100`
- The graph is undirected and simple (no self-loops or duplicate edges)

---

## Output Format

Please follow the course instruction provided in `hw3.pdf`.

Output a single integer â€” the chromatic number of the graph.
